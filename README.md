# Student-attendance-management-system
The Attendance Management System was developed as a role-based portal using Python, designed to streamline academic attendance tracking for both students and teachers.
Built entirely from scratch using object-oriented programming and in-memory string handling, the system supported over 100 users and offered a clean command-line interface for interaction. With separate access points for students and faculty, it provided features such as adding, editing, viewing, and grading attendance records in a structured and user-friendly format.
